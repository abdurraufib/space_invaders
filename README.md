Space Invaders
===========================
By Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf <ibrauf@umich.edu>

My own recreation of the Japanese Space Invaders shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. The objective of the game is to battle waves of incoming enemy spaceships for as long as possible. The program incorporates a health bar, keeps track of the score, utilizes spawning and collision mechanisms, and initializes the game with a menu screen.
