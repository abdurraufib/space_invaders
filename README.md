Space Invaders
===========================
By Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf <ibrauf@umich.edu>

My own recreation of the Japanese \textit{Space Invaders} shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. The objective of the game is to battle incoming enemy spaceships for as long as possible. The program incorporates a health and a score status bar, utilizes spawning and collision mechanisms, and initializes the game with a menu screen.
